# Cloud provider config

This doc describes cloud provider config file, which is to be used via `--cloud-config` flag of azure-cloud-controller-manager.

Here is a config file sample:

```json
{
    "cloud":"AzurePublicCloud",
    "tenantId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "aadClientId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "aadClientSecret": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "subscriptionId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "resourceGroup": "<name>",
    "location": "eastus",
    "subnetName": "<name>",
    "securityGroupName": "<name>",
    "vnetName": "<name>",
    "vnetResourceGroup": "",
    "routeTableName": "<name>",
    "primaryAvailabilitySetName": "<name>",
    "routeTableResourceGroup": "<name>",
    "cloudProviderBackoff": false,
    "useManagedIdentityExtension": false,
    "useInstanceMetadata": true
}
```

Note: All values are of string type if not explicitly called out.

## Auth configs

|Name|Description|Remark|
|---|---|---|
|cloud|The cloud environment identifier|Valid values could be found  [here](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest/blob/v9.9.0/autorest/azure/environments.go#L29). Default to `AzurePublicCloud`.|
|tenantID|The AAD Tenant ID for the Subscription that the cluster is deployed in|**Required**.|
|aadClientID|The ClientID for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for service principal authn.|
|aadClientSecret|The ClientSecret for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for service principal  authn.|
|aadClientCertPath|The path of a client certificate for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for client cert authn.|
|aadClientCertPassword|The password of the client certificate for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for client cert authn.|
|useManagedIdentityExtension|Use managed service identity for the virtual machine to access Azure ARM APIs|Boolean type, default to false.|
|userAssignedIdentityID|The Client ID of the user assigned MSI which is assigned to the underlying VMs|Required for user-assigned managed identity.|
|subscriptionId|The ID of the Azure Subscription that the cluster is deployed in|**Required**.|
|identitySystem|The identity system for AzureStack. Supported values are: ADFS|Only used for AzureStack|

Note: Cloud provider currently supports three authentication methods, you can choose one combination of them:

- [Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview):
  - For system-assigned managed identity: set `useManagedIdentityExtension` to true
  - For user-assigned managed identity: set `useManagedIdentityExtension` to true and also set `userAssignedIdentityID`
- [Service Principal](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/topics/service-principals.md): set `aadClientID` and `aadClientSecret`
- [Client Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-service-to-service): set `aadClientCertPath` and `aadClientCertPassword`

If more than one value is set, the order is `Managed Identity` > `Service Principal` > `Client Certificate`.

### primaryAvailabilitySetName

If this is set, the Azure cloudprovider will only add nodes from that availability set to the load
balancer backend pool. If this is not set, and multiple agent pools (availability sets) are used, then
the cloudprovider will try to add all nodes to a single backend pool which is forbidden.
In other words, if you use multiple agent pools (availability sets), you MUST set this field.

### primaryScaleSetName

If this is set, the Azure cloudprovider will only add nodes from that scale set to the load
balancer backend pool. If this is not set, and multiple agent pools (scale sets) are used, then
the cloudprovider will try to add all nodes to a single backend pool which is forbidden when using Load Balancer Basic SKU.
In other words, if you use multiple agent pools (scale sets), and `loadBalancerSku` is set to `basic` you MUST set this field.

### excludeMasterFromStandardLB

Master nodes would not add to the backends of Azure LoadBalancer (ALB) if `excludeMasterFromStandardLB` is set.

By default, if nodes are labeled with `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`, they would also be excluded from ALB. If you want adding the master nodes to ALB, `excludeMasterFromStandardLB` should be set to false and label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` should be removed if it has already been applied.

### Setting Azure cloud provider from Kubernetes secrets

Since v1.15.0, Azure cloud provider supports reading the cloud config from Kubernetes secrets. The secret is a serialized version of `azure.json` file with key `cloud-config`. The secret should be put in `kube-system` namespace and its name should be `azure-cloud-provider`.

To enable this feature, set `cloudConfigType` to `secret` or `merge` (default is `merge`). All supported values for this option are:

- `file`: The cloud provider configuration is read from cloud-config file.
- `secret`: the cloud provider configuration must be overridden by the secret.
- `merge`: the cloud provider configuration can be optionally overridden by a secret when it is set explicitly in the secret, this is default value.

Since Azure cloud provider would read Kubernetes secrets, the following RBAC should also be configured:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
  name: system:azure-cloud-provider-secret-getter
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  resourceNames: ["azure-cloud-provider"]
  verbs:
  - get
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
  name: system:azure-cloud-provider-secret-getter
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:azure-cloud-provider-secret-getter
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: azure-cloud-provider
  namespace: kube-system
```

## Run Kubelet without Azure identity

When running Kubelet with kube-controller-manager, it also supports running without Azure identity since v1.15.0.

Both kube-controller-manager and kubelet should configure `--cloud-provider=azure --cloud-config=/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`, but the contents for `azure.json` are different:

(1) For kube-controller-manager, refer the above part for setting `azure.json`.

(2) For kubelet, `useInstanceMetadata` is required to be `true` and Azure identities are not required. A sample for Kubelet's azure.json is

```json
{
  "useInstanceMetadata": true,
  "vmType": "vmss"
}
```

## Azure Stack Configuration

Azure Stack has different API endpoints, depending on the Azure Stack deployment. These need to be provided to the Azure SDK and currently this is done by adding an extra `json` file with the arguments, as well as an environment variable pointing to this file.

There are several available presets, namely:

- `AzureChinaCloud`
- `AzureGermanCloud`
- `AzurePublicCloud`
- `AzureUSGovernmentCloud`

These are determined using `cloud: <PRESET>` described above in the description of `azure.json`.

When `cloud: AzureStackCloud`, the extra environment variable used by the Azure SDK to find the Azure Stack configuration file is:

  - [`AZURE_ENVIRONMENT_FILEPATH`](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest/blob/562d376/autorest/azure/environments.go#L28)

The configuration parameters of this file:

```json
{
  "name": "AzureStackCloud",
  "managementPortalURL": "...",
  "publishSettingsURL": "...",
  "serviceManagementEndpoint": "...",
  "resourceManagerEndpoint": "...",
  "activeDirectoryEndpoint": "...",
  "galleryEndpoint": "...",
  "keyVaultEndpoint": "...",
  "graphEndpoint": "...",
  "serviceBusEndpoint": "...",
  "batchManagementEndpoint": "...",
  "storageEndpointSuffix": "...",
  "sqlDatabaseDNSSuffix": "...",
  "trafficManagerDNSSuffix": "...",
  "keyVaultDNSSuffix": "...",
  "serviceBusEndpointSuffix": "...",
  "serviceManagementVMDNSSuffix": "...",
  "resourceManagerVMDNSSuffix": "...",
  "containerRegistryDNSSuffix": "...",
  "cosmosDBDNSSuffix": "...",
  "tokenAudience": "...",
  "resourceIdentifiers": {
    "graph": "...",
    "keyVault": "...",
    "datalake": "...",
    "batch": "...",
    "operationalInsights": "..."
  }
}
```

The full list of existing settings for the `AzureChinaCloud`, `AzureGermanCloud`, `AzurePublicCloud` and `AzureUSGovernmentCloud` is available in the source code at https:/ <script data-ad-client="ca-pub-7798521375992570" async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> /github.com/Azure/go-autorest/blob/master/autorest/azure/environments.go#L51
